Title: Neuromorphic Swarming: A Brain-Inspired Framework for Autonomous Drone Coordination

Abstract
The growing use of drone swarms in essential areas like disaster response, environmental monitoring, and military surveillance calls for innovative solutions to address existing challenges in energy efficiency, scalability, and real-time adaptability. This paper presents a groundbreaking idea: Neuromorphic Swarming, which utilizes brain-inspired designs to facilitate autonomous, intelligent, and efficient coordination among swarms. By incorporating spiking neural networks (SNNs) and neuromorphic hardware, we suggest a decentralized, event-driven, and adaptive framework for practical swarm operations. The system features new algorithms for spike-based communication, dynamic neural plasticity to adapt to environmental changes, and energy-efficient decision-making strategies. Simulations and prototype tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, showcasing its potential to transform drone swarming technology.
